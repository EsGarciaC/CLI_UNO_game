# CLI_UNO_game
Made as a College project, this game is a 4-player command line UNO game made in Java where a you play against 3 bots to win. All Cards except for the +4 are integrated, as the game goes indefinitely until a player gets to 0 cards.

**Note:** The Game uses ANSI-colors, so you'll need a compatible "console". Windows 10's command line supports ANSI-colors natively.
